If you've ever wanted to remove the spinners from a number input, you're not alone.

While they can be useful, they can also be distracting or unwanted. Let's see how to remove them in Tailwind CSS.

## CSS Class

This solution works in any framework and uses CSS properties.

```css
.no-spinner {
  appearance: textfield;
}

.no-spinner::-webkit-outer-spin-button,
.no-spinner::-webkit-inner-spin-button {
  appearance: none;
  margin: 0;
}
```

Add the `no-spinner` class to your number inputs to remove the spinners.

## Tailwind CSS Class

```css
@layer components {
  .no-spinner {
    appearance: textfield;
  }

  .no-spinner::-webkit-outer-spin-button,
  .no-spinner::-webkit-inner-spin-button {
    appearance: none;
    margin: 0;
  }
}
```

This integrates the `no-spinner` class into Tailwind CSS v4. It will show up in Tailwind CSS Intellisense in VS Code.

## Tailwind CSS Inline

```html
<input
  type="number"
  class="[appearance:textfield] [&::-webkit-inner-spin-button]:m-0 [&::-webkit-inner-spin-button]:appearance-none [&::-webkit-outer-spin-button]:m-0 [&::-webkit-outer-spin-button]:appearance-none"
/>
```

[Take a look at the 3 examples here](https://play.tailwindcss.com/9lCLR4jK5d?layout=preview).

That's all! Which approach should you use? I recommend adding a Tailwind CSS class with `@layer`, but the choice is yours.
